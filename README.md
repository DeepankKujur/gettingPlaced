## Features

### For Job Seekers:

* **View All Jobs**: Job seekers can access a comprehensive list of all job postings available on the platform. This feature provides an overview of the job title, company, job location, and other important details.
  
* **Search Jobs**: A search bar allows job seekers to filter through jobs based on keywords such as job title, location, company, and more. This helps users find relevant opportunities quickly.

* **Apply for Jobs**: Job seekers can apply directly to any job listing they are interested in. Upon applying, they may be required to submit their resume, cover letter, and any other relevant documents. Their application will be sent to the employer for review.

### For Employers:

* **Post Jobs**: Employers can post new job opportunities on the platform. This feature includes options to add job title, description, qualifications, skills required, location, and salary details. Employers have full control over their postings.

* **View Applications**: Employers can review applications submitted by job seekers. The platform allows them to see the resume, cover letter, and any other documents uploaded by applicants. Employers can also filter applications based on criteria.

* **Schedule Interviews**: Once an employer has shortlisted candidates, they can schedule interviews using the Zoom API. The employer generates a Zoom meeting link and sends it directly to the applicant's email via Nodemailer.

* **Email Notifications**: Employers can send email notifications to applicants to confirm their interview schedule or inform them about job updates. This email functionality is handled by Nodemailer, ensuring reliable communication with job seekers.

## Usage

### Job Seeker:

1. **Register/Login**: A job seeker must first create an account or log in to the platform. Registration requires basic details like name, email, and password. Once registered, users can access their profile and start browsing jobs.

2. **Browse Jobs**: After logging in, job seekers can view a list of all available jobs on the platform. Each job posting contains essential details like job description, qualifications, and application deadlines.

3. **Search Jobs**: The platform provides a search feature, where job seekers can enter specific keywords, such as job titles, skills, or locations. This functionality helps narrow down the list of jobs to those that match their preferences.

4. **Apply**: Once a job seeker finds an interesting job, they can apply directly on the platform. This may involve submitting a resume, cover letter, and any other documents required by the employer. Applications are sent to the respective employer for review.

5. **Interview Invitations**: After applying, job seekers may receive interview invitations via email. The email will contain details about the interview, including the date, time, and the Zoom meeting link generated by the employer.

### Employer:

1. **Register/Login**: Employers need to create an account or log in to the platform to access the job posting features. Registration is similar to the job seeker’s registration but with employer-specific details such as company name and job postings.

2. **Post Jobs**: Employers can create new job listings on the platform. This includes adding a job title, description, salary, qualifications, and location. Employers can choose from a variety of fields to create a detailed job description.

3. **Manage Jobs**: Employers can view, edit, or delete any of their job postings. If a job posting needs updates or is no longer available, employers can manage the posting status easily through the dashboard.

4. **View Applications**: Employers can view applications submitted by job seekers. The platform allows them to see all the resumes, cover letters, and other documents that were uploaded by candidates. Employers can filter applicants based on various criteria.

5. **Schedule Interviews**: Once an employer shortlists candidates, they can invite them for interviews using the Zoom API. The platform automatically generates a Zoom meeting link that is shared with the applicant. An email invitation with the Zoom link is sent via Nodemailer to ensure proper communication.
